# Loan-default-analysis

This project is an analysis to identify customers who might default on their first payment. Through this project, I wanted to identify the important 
factors that indicate towards applicant defaulting.

# DATA
The data is from a company called Net Pay Advance, that lends small loans to customers. Here, each row indicates a loan application.
